# Traveling_Salesman_Problem
## Introduction
This is my solution for the third homework for the course Intelligent Systems at FMI year 4.
The goal is to implement a genetic crossover algorithm that finds the shortest path through a set of towns. The requirement is that the path passes only once through each town. 
## Documentation
Due to time constraints a proper documentation will be added later.
